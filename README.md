<h1> GBD3 Analysis Scripts</h1>
### 3d_quarter_distribution.py
calculate distribution of ligand in each spherical quarter around the enzyme while leaving the active site
### Rgr_Diff.py                 
calculate radius of gyration and theoretical diffusion coefficient 
### count_termination_dcd.py    
calculate total number of bindings, dwell time and direct binders considering limits as a sphere for direct binders. Use dcds as input. Need dcd.py to be in the same folder to run this script.
### count_termination_dcd_2.py  
calculate total number of bindings, dwell time and direct binders considering limits as a box for direct binders. Use dcds as input. Need dcd.py to be in the same folder to run this script.
### dcd.py                      
Not generated by me. Helps to read dcd files alone. outputs an array of xyz coordinates.
### histo_association.py        
Histogram map of all replica's association time using 1 or 2 data files
### l_distribution_dcd.py       
calculate distribution of ligands in spherical slices around the target protein
### n_binds.py                  
find kON, Running time, Bindings, Standard deviation of Tavg and Tavg using data_log file
### pdb_center.py              
translate the centroid pdb to center (0,0,0)
### periodic_distribution.py    
calculate diffusion coefficient of ligand in a periodic box
### zaxis_percent.py            
calculate distribution of ligand replicas within slices stacked along z-axis
