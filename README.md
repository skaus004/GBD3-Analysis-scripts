# GBD3 Analysis Scripts
#### 3d_quarter_distribution.py
(calculate distribution of ligand in each spherical quarter around the enzyme while leaving the active site)
Rgr_Diff.py                 | (calculate radius of gyration and theoretical diffusion coefficient )
<br>
count_termination_dcd.py    | (calculate total number of bindings, dwell time and direct binders considering limits as a sphere for direct binders. Use dcds as input. Need dcd.py to be in the same folder to run this script.)
<br>
count_termination_dcd_2.py  | (calculate total number of bindings, dwell time and direct binders considering limits as a box for direct binders. Use dcds as input. Need dcd.py to be in the same folder to run this script.)
<br>
dcd.py                      | (Not generated by me. Helps to read dcd files alone. outputs an array of xyz coordinates.)
<br>
histo_association.py        | (Histogram map of all replica's association time using 1 or 2 data files)
<br>
l_distribution_dcd.py       | (calculate distribution of ligands in spherical slices around the target protein)
<br>
n_binds.py                  | (find kON, Running time, Bindings, Standard deviation of Tavg and Tavg using data_log file)
<br> 
pdb_center.py               | (translate the centroid pdb to center (0,0,0))
<br>
periodic_distribution.py    | (calculate diffusion coefficient of ligand in a periodic box)
<br>
zaxis_percent.py            | (calculate distribution of ligand replicas within slices stacked along z-axis)
